## Recommendation
- Revenue is currently heavily reliant on the **Delhi NCR market**, particularly on **Electricalsara Stores**, making sales highly susceptible to volatility. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to diversify the sales network by targeting a broader customer base and **expanding into additional markets**. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to further **develop e-commerce channels**, which currently contribute only a small share of the total revenue
- In high **Gross Profit** markets like **Bhubaneshwar, Hyderabad, and Chennai** with limited customers, businesses should focus on increasing revenue by maximizing value from existing customers through **up-sell**, **cross-sell**, and tailored incentives. Expanding the customer network can be achieved by encouraging referrals from current retailers with **commission-based rewards**. Additionally, enhance **brand awareness** through B2B marketing strategies such as hosting **workshops** and participating in **trade exhibitions** to build credibility and attract new retailers
- **Electricalsara Store** is the largest revenue-generating customer, operating in three markets: **Mumbai, Bhopal, and Delhi NCR**. However, 99% of its revenue comes from the **Delhi NCR** market, where the **Profit Margin** is low. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on **cost optimization** in areas such as **logistics**, as well as consider **increasing prices** or **offering additional complementary products** to improve profitability
- The **Kanpur** market generates a **Gross Profit** of 0.4%, however, the **Zone** and **Control** customers in this market have negative profit margins of **-18.6%** and **-22.2%** respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the cost factors impacting profitability or consider **discontinuing** these customers to optimize business performance
